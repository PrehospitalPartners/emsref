		"abstract": "Background: End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) measurement has been shown to have prognostic value in acute trauma. Objective: Evaluate the association of prehospital EtCO2 and in-hospital mortality in trauma patients and to assess its prognostic value when compared to traditional vital signs. Methods: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of patients transported by a single EMS agency to a level one trauma center. We evaluated initial out-of-hospital vital signs documented by EMS personnel including EtCO2, respiratory rate (RR), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), pulse (P), and oxygen saturation (O2) and hospital data. The main outcome measure was mortality. Results: 135 trauma patients were included; 9 (7%) did not survive. The mean age of patients was 40 (SD17) [Range 16–89], 97 (72%) were male, 76 (56%) were admitted to the hospital and 15 (11%) went to the ICU. The mean EtCO2 level was 18 mmHg (95%CI 9–28) [Range 5–41] in non-survivors compared to 34 mmHg (95%CI 32–35) [Range 11–51] in survivors. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for EtCO2 in predicting mortality was 0.84 (0.67–1.00) (p = 0.001), RR was 0.82 (0.63–1.00), SBP was 0.72 (0.49–0.96), DBP was 0.72 (0.47–0.97), pulse was 0.51 (0.26–0.76), and O2 was 0.64 (0.37–0.91). Cut-off values at 30 mmHg yielded sensitivity = 89% (51–99), specificity = 68% (59–76), PPV = 13% (6–24) and NPV = 99% (93–100) for predicting mortality. There was no correlation between RR and EtCO2 (correlation 0.16; p = 0.06). Conclusion: We found an inverse association between prehospital EtCO2 and mortality. This has implications for improving triage and assisting EMS in directing patients to an appropriate trauma center.",

		"abstract": "Introduction\nCognitive activity and awareness during cardiac arrest (CA) are reported but ill understood. This first of a kind study examined consciousness and its underlying electrocortical biomarkers during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\nMethods\nIn a prospective 25-site in-hospital study, we incorporated a) independent audiovisual testing of awareness, including explicit and implicit learning using a computer and headphones, with b) continuous real-time electroencephalography(EEG) and cerebral oxygenation(rSO2) monitoring into CPR during in-hospital CA (IHCA). Survivors underwent interviews to examine for recall of awareness and cognitive experiences. A complementary cross-sectional community CA study provided added insights regarding survivors’ experiences.\nResults\nOf 567 IHCA, 53(9.3%) survived, 28 of these (52.8%) completed interviews, and 11(39.3%) reported CA memories/perceptions suggestive of consciousness. Four categories of experiences emerged: 1) emergence from coma during CPR (CPR-induced consciousness [CPRIC]) 2/28(7.1%), or 2) in the post-resuscitation period 2/28(7.1%), 3) dream-like experiences 3/28(10.7%), 4) transcendent recalled experience of death (RED) 6/28(21.4%). In the cross-sectional arm, 126 community CA survivors’ experiences reinforced these categories and identified another: delusions (misattribution of medical events). Low survival limited the ability to examine for implicit learning. Nobody identified the visual image, 1/28(3.5%) identified the auditory stimulus. Despite marked cerebral ischemia (Mean rSO2 = 43%) normal EEG activity (delta, theta and alpha) consistent with consciousness emerged as long as 35–60 minutes into CPR.\nConclusions\nConsciousness. awareness and cognitive processes may occur during CA. The emergence of normal EEG may reflect a resumption of a network-level of cognitive activity, and a biomarker of consciousness, lucidity and RED (authentic “near-death” experiences).",
